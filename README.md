# University Campus Network Project
A Cisco Packet Tracer project simulating the network infrastructure of a university campus, including multiple departments, routers, switches, servers, and client devices.
This repository contains a Cisco Packet Tracer simulation of a university campus network. The project models the communication infrastructure of an academic environment, including departmental LANs, centralized servers, inter-VLAN routing, and internet connectivity.

## 📁 File

- `UNIVERSITY CAMPUS NETWORK PROJECT.pkt`  
  A Cisco Packet Tracer file representing the complete network topology.

## 🏛️ Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a campus network with:

- Multiple departments (e.g., Computer Science, Electronics, Administration)
- Interconnected switches and routers
- IP addressing and subnetting strategy
- DHCP and DNS configuration
- Centralized server access
- Secure communication between segments
- Simulated internet access

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer (Version 8.2 or higher recommended)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Download and install [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer).
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open `UNIVERSITY CAMPUS NETWORK PROJECT.pkt` using Cisco Packet Tracer.
4. Explore the topology, test connectivity (ping, traceroute), or modify configurations.

## 📌 Features Demonstrated

- Static and dynamic routing
- VLAN setup and trunking
- DHCP & DNS server configuration
- Device configuration using CLI
- Basic network security considerations
